## General Information
*Website solely using Javascript, HTML, and CSS.*
This web page computes the compound interest based off user input. 
User input within the text box only allows numbers. Whenever there is 
an input, the compound interest will compute automatically. The web page 
also consists of a button input that will send you to a Business Insiders 
article on Compound Interest. Below the button, there is a link to this Github
repository for anyone to view the source code.
